                        <h3>A protocol that is respected </h3>
                        <p>All local and regional authorities that have engaged in the La Transfo program have respected
                            the general protocol: around 20 agents have been made available and mobilized; the
                            professionals mandated to accompany the initiative have not been restricted in any way in
                            designing and leading the sessions; the uncertainty linked to the experimental and
                            progressive nature of the approach has been accepted (to a certain extent).
                        </p>

                        <h3>The pressure to obtain results</h3>
                        <p>In reality, it is difficult to reconcile the program’s ambition with its cost to the
                            municipality/region in regard to the trial-and-error approach and the testing inherent in
                            experimentation. It was consequently necessary to remind the participating authorities,
                            several times and at various stages of the program, of the initiative’s experimental
                            framework. The executive branch, for instance, like the agents, often expressed high
                            expectations regarding the results of practical cases, forgetting that the role of the
                            latter is above all to test new methods for taking action and possible ways of operating for
                            the future lab.
                        </p>

                        <h3>An imperfect understanding of the context</h3>
                        <p>Creating a framework that is truly partnership-based means clarifying the expectations of
                            each partner, as needed. In some of La Transfos, the discussions held before protocol
                            startup were not enough to allow La 27e Région to understand the reasons why the authority’s
                            executive branch wished to participate in the program and the organizational, managerial and
                            political context in which La Transfo was situated.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The complicated role of the in-house leader</h3>
                        <p>The role of the “in-house leader” illustrates the difficulty of the municipality/region to
                            assume the program’s experimental and partnership-based framework: should this person be
                            presented as the future director of the lab although the idea is to co-build it (including
                            its team and leadership) during and as a result of La Transfo? Is this person above all
                            responsible for organizing and facilitating the participation of his/her colleagues and/or
                            is he/she an ambassador among others who must also fully participate in the work sessions?
                            Is he/she the associate of the “residents” who are leading the initiative (including in
                            their posture of “well-meaning” hacking of the institution) and/or the representative of the
                            authority’s general management acting as the liaison with La 27e Région?
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <h3>An initiative dominated by design</h3>
                        <p>Given that design was by far the dominating method employed in the teams and in the initial
                            experimental framework focussed on lab design and given the extensive similarities in the
                            methodologies implemented in all the La Transfos in setting up their practical cases, it can
                            be concluded that La Transfo is a program dominated by design, the other disciplines acting
                            in support of this basic discipline or in counterpoint to it.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The design / reflexivity combination</h3>
                        <p> The strong representation of reflexivity postures (sociologist, political scientist, adult
                            education practitioners) acting as a “secondary” capability has demonstrated the interest of
                            associating critical approaches to the practices of design, primarily in regard to defining
                            the laboratory. The professionals who worked together on the project developed a tendency to
                            continue their cooperative efforts (in four La Transfo teams out of seven).
                        </p>

                        <h3>Investigate other formats for involvement</h3>
                        <p> In some instances, residents who were not designers expressed their frustration concerning
                            their individual input. The means for involving these profiles could perhaps be mixed with
                            other formats in order to deepen their involvement (for example, as regards investigation
                            methods, data processing, etc.), or in regard to project evaluation, etc.

                        regularly, on some of its specific points and at a small scale. The duration and frequency of
                        these actions should be such that the acculturation of 20 agent ambassadors is integrated, a
                        group dynamic involving the same group of persons has been created and the lab has been
                        co-built. The premise of the program also concerns <span>flexibility</span>: since program
                        rollout took place bit by bit, it was possible to decide collectively whether to pursue or stop
                        a practical case, take advantage of a new opportunity, leave more room for an
                        educational/learning dimension, etc.

                        <h3>From the standpoint of acculturation to the challenges and methods for public transformation
                        </h3>
                        <p>the duration of the program left sufficient time for the ambassador agents to discover,
                            experiment, obtain a critical eye, gain perspective on the specifics of the municipality and
                            on other public innovation lab experiments, etc. It also allowed for carrying out various
                            tests and for taking advantage of any opportunities that cropped up, with some practical
                            cases turned more towards learning/apprenticeship and others that changed into
                            proof-of-concept trials with a particularly conclusive result (which is often difficult to
                            anticipate!). The duration also allowed for leadership of the future lab to emerge.
                        </p>

                        <h3>From the standpoint of mobilizing the ambassador agents and of creating a group dynamic</h3>
                        <p>the duration and pace of the program were hard to maintain in all the La Transfos: workloads
                            of agents without specific posts, changes in posts (or even in municipality), a decline in
                            motivation, etc. This was confirmed in the final sessions, where participation was spotty,
                            and attendance reduced to around ten persons.
                        </p>

                        <h3>From the standpoint of co-building the lab</h3>
                        <p>the pace of the sessions did not necessarily correspond to the time required for thinking
                            about the lab, for engaging in negotiations and for taking any decisions concerning it. The
                            fast pace at the end of La Transfo in particular, with sessions focussed on the future lab
                            organized quite close together, turned out to be very restrictive and occurred too fast to
                            allow the administration to organize itself and form validations.
                        </p>

                        <h3>From the standpoint of organizing the work of the residents (the professionals mandated to
                            lead the initiative)
                        </h3>
                        <p>the duration and pace of the program allowed for understanding the authority’s organization,
                            its culture and in-house geopolitics and for identifying its challenges. The fast pace was
                            nonetheless highly restrictive, making it hard to take a step back for an objective look and
                            for the residents to organize work between sessions, and namely in order to schedule work in
                            the field (the drawback of flexibility!); this led to a lack of visibility and the
                            incapacity to project into the future, to anticipate the results of practical cases, for
                            instance, etc.

                            across-the-board approach. Encouraging a group of agents (including blue collar workers) to
                            work together, bypassing silos and hierarchies, is a vector for innovation and cooperation.
                            Their intimate knowledge of the workings of their administration made it possible to account
                            for the context in conducting the practical cases and in building the lab.

                        <h3>A lack of clarity regarding the objectives </h3>
                        <p>The status of the program and its objectives are not always clearly understood: is the task
                            first of all to train the agents or to carry out innovation projects (the practical cases) ?
                            <br>The training element is not fully complete; there is no validation of the
                            skills/knowledge acquired, no official recognition by the respective HR departments. The
                            program caused discomfort for some agents (no recognition/support from their direct
                            superiors nor from their colleagues).
                        </p>

                        <h3>The thorny question of scale </h3>
                        <p>Is 20 agents the right number? At the scale of a major urban area, the ripple effect remains
                            limited and the actions deployed may even be seen as privileged, as belonging to a “club”.

                                        the subject of the 1st practical case investigated by La Transfo Metz. On the
                                        basis of a survey, the ambassadors steered the practical case towards mobility
                                        possibilities that were more respectful of the environment and that promoted
                                        wellbeing at work.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="strong">This practical case is a good example of an ambassador group
                                        acting on its own initiative in relation to an issue in-house, and provided the
                                        opportunity to train the agents on the entire methodological process of
                                        designing a service.

                                    <p>The 1st La Transfo case investigated in Lille was Amélio, a scheme set up to
                                        accompany and finance renovation works in homes to lower energy consumption in
                                        the metropolitan area of Lille. The goal of this practical case was to improve
                                        recourse to this scheme, which was being under-used. Working on the case led to
                                        two experiments, one concerning a mediation mechanism (a housing health card)
                                        and the second a proximity service (the “Brico-Concierge”, or a neighborhood of

                                        decided to tackle an in-house issue: improving the procedure for managing the
                                        bases of trees. To work on this highly technical subject, La Transfo proposed
                                        mapping the procedure, starting with the testimonies of the various players and
                                        services involved in tree base management. After a few sessions, La Transfo drew
                                        up a blueprint detailing a procedure far more complex than one would think.

                        <p>There is no ideal way to capitalize on La Transfo to conduct a practical case, nor is there
                            any typical deliverable. In fact, the La Transfo experimental framework is best used for
                            testing a variety of methods for future lab operation (being called in on a practical case,
                            following the directive of a decision-maker or that of a managing entity, or acting on its
                            initiative, etc.), and in regard to multiple subjects (digital project, in-house
                            organization, innovation of a service, an administrative procedure, etc.), to various goals
                            (improve recourse to a mechanism, develop a new service, become more aware of practices,
                            build shared visions for changing a service, etc.) and to different work methods (immersion
                            in the field, prototyping and testing, debugging workshops, etc.). It is only by
                            experimenting with a variety of situations (and thus encountering failure from time to time)
                            that La Transfo can discern, little by little, what works well in the administrative context
                            in which it is found.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The problem of producing and training simultaneously</h3>
                        <p>There is often only a very fine line between practical exercise and real project. This
                            ambiguity has been felt in all La Transfos. In reality, the cursor keeps moving throughout
                            the program: the first cases work particularly well when there is a significant element of
                            learning involved because this allows for setting up a reference framework and for garnering
                            common knowledge regarding what can precisely be called a public innovation project. As the
                            initiative progresses, the importance of producing results increases, to both reassure the
                            agents involved of the interest of these methods and to maintain a good level of motivation,
                            and just as importantly to engage the managing entities in the initiative and make them want
                            to renew the experiment.

                        <h3>A few conditions to ensure the success of a case </h3>
                        <p>In all instances, practical cases work better when various conditions are fulfilled before
                            the case is launched :
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>The experimental nature of the practical case must be shared with the
                                        sponsors of the initiative</strong><br>
                                    which is different from an in-house advisory task. Time must be set aside to explain
                                    the experimental framework of La Transfo to those sponsoring the initiative, so as
                                    to clearly identify the educational goals, the timeline restrictions, the
                                    non-obligation to obtain results, etc. This has often proved salutary in avoiding
                                    disappointment.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Ensure the level of commitment of the initiative sponsor : </strong><br>
                                    one of the specifics of practical cases is the involvement of agents from the
                                    department sponsoring the case. It is important to explain the manner in which the
                                    agents and partners of the department concerned will be mobilized (presence during
                                    the initial immersion sessions, during the presentation of results, etc.).
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Verify the case’s technical and political support : </strong><br>
                                    sometimes a subject that is highly supported by decision-makers faces a complex
                                    administrative reality. (For example the subject of recruiting unusual profiles,
                                    backed politically, may be viewed as a non-priority by HR management or by teams
                                    that have identified other issues they consider more important.) The work of La
                                    Transfo risks being poorly perceived and poorly experienced if this support is
                                    absent and the results will have little chance of being appropriated.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Clearly define the work of La Transfo on a given subject : </strong><br>
                                    the risk exists of remaining “stuck” on a practical case, which undermines the
                                    enthusiasm of the participating agents and prohibits working with a variety
                                    departments and on a range of subjects. To avoid this, the task must be clearly
                                    defined from the very start, identifying where work on the practical case ends
                                    (number of sessions, expected production, educational/training objectives, etc.).
                                    Sometimes cases are continued (for instance when a public service wishes to test one
                                    of the mechanisms devised during La Transfo brainstorming sessions); in this event,
                                    accompanying the project is often a much lighter task and is carried out in parallel
                                    with the deployment of other practical cases.

                        So that the future lab is not viewed by public agents as not touching ground, as being isolated
                        or as having been set up to erase whatever exists, La Transfo offers a propitious framework for
                        weaving ties with the innovation ecosystem that already exists within and around the
                        local/regional authority. This concerns both <span>in-house procedures</span>, for which the
                        approach is centered on practices, and <span>players outside the authority</span> who
                        participate in the public innovation momentum (associations, service providers, universities,
                        etc.). The creation of the laboratory corresponds to the ambition to set to music, provide
                        support for, provide governance of and to form mutually strengthening ties between these
                        elements. From this viewpoint, the very essence of La Transfo is to plant the seeds for future
                        cooperative efforts. Carrying out practical cases, organizing presentation times to the public
                        and co-building the lab all contribute to widening and diversifying the circle of agents
                        appropriating the procedure. La Transfo also contributes to consolidating a dynamic innovation
                        ecosystem at the scale of a region by creating ties with design schools, political science
                        schools, etc., and to identifying potential resources and partnerships for the future lab during
                        the La Transfo initiative.

                        <h3>The problem of finding room for La Transfo in a rich in-house ecosystem </h3>
                        <p>La Transfo sometimes came up against multiple and scattered innovation initiatives conducted
                            within the municipalities/regions; this was primarily the case for the biggest authorities
                            (Paris, Occitanie Région), where it was difficult to identify and make contact with these
                            initiatives and their sponsoring departments and to structure the relationship with them. In
                            Occitanie as in Paris, the creation of a project management entity grouping together the lab
                            and several other initiatives (Open Data, Sustainable city and participative innovation in
                            Paris, Managerial innovation and citizen participation in Occitanie) provided an initial
                            response to this problem even though in reality cooperating on and conducting shared
                            projects with these programs remained limited.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The key role of persons</h3>
                        <p>The building of an in-house innovation ecosystem based on the future lab (or in connection
                            with it) came about, in the end, as a result of the participation of agents sponsoring La
                            Transfo’s innovative initiatives, acting either as ambassadors or as the leaders/managers of
                            a practical case. For example in Paris, the task officer in charge of innovation with the
                            Social affairs directorate was an active ambassador of La Transfo and helped establish
                            privileged ties between the future lab and the managerial staff of this office. Similarly,
                            in Strasbourg, strong ties were made with the Innovative times and services taskforce and
                            with the managers of the digital project, which were sponsored respectively by an in-house
                            manager and a La Transfo ambassador.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The need for a long period of time to set up cooperative programs</h3>
                        <p>Creating knowledge sharing/interchange followed by establishing the means for cooperating
                            requires considerable time, which has proved incompatible with the pace of the La Transfo
                            sessions. The time set aside for encounters among the sponsors of innovative initiatives
                            organized within several La Transfos was more or less successful because it is hard to
                            juggle multiple agendas. The substantive work carried out by some of the in-house leaders,
                            outside the sessions, to meet with these in-house and external innovation players and to
                            devise ways for working together or for pooling information was undoubtedly more effective
                            and merits being pursued within the scope of the lab.

                                    <p>in all the La Transfos, the question of the lab was raised at different points in
                                        time: the first was to draft the overall expectations of the lab in terms of the
                                        service offered to the municipality/region, following by several successive
                                        times to fully develop the service offer, to set up lab organization in-house
                                        and to identify its reporting line, tools, physical location, stakeholders
                                        (teams and ambassadors) and budget.
                                    </p>

                                        detailed as the work sessions advanced, often concretized this process. On
                                        average, six days were devoted to the future lab over the entire initiative,
                                        with an intensification of sessions towards the end of La Transfo.

                                        <li><strong>In Paris</strong>, an afternoon was devoted to building the future

                                    <p class="subtitle">A lab that already exists</p>
                                    <p>In the Occitanie Région, the lab already existed in the organization chart and
                                        consisted of a small team when La Transfo was started. The co-building exercise
                                        was focussed on the lab’s types of work and its means of communication and on
                                        constituting and operation of the lab network. A decorrelation occurred between
                                        the strategic choices tied to the existing lab (sizing of the team, its
                                        perimeter of action, its governance) and La Transfo, which resulted in making
                                        the existing lab more visible and concrete (initial practical cases = initial
                                        projects of the lab) and in making it widely known, namely via the work of the
                                        ambassadors.

                        <h3>A decision-making process to be clarified and structured with the session work </h3>
                        <p>In several La Transfos, the co-building work with the ambassadors came up against the reality
                            of the municipality’s/region’s decision-making process. The questions of the lab’s resources
                            (budget, human resources, etc.) and of its hierarchical and institutional reporting line
                            were consequently discussed outside the sessions and directly by the leaders of the
                            initiative (the residents) and/or the in-house leader with the authority’s general
                            management or with the lab’s sponsoring department and sometimes even with an ad hoc
                            steering committee. This situation sometimes caused a feeling of frustration or of
                            incomprehension on the part of the ambassadors.
                            <br>
                            Moreover, the work of focussing on the future lab was too abstract a task for some
                            ambassadors, which resulted in their imagining a lab modeled on the one they knew, La
                            Transfo. Others tended to see the lab principally from their viewpoint as agents, from an
                            extremely in-house position in support of their colleagues, or as organization consultants.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The notable absence of elected officials (and sometimes directors) in the initiative</h3>
                        <p>Almost all La Transfos failed to engage any elected officials in conducting the practical
                            cases and in devoting time to building the lab. In some municipalities/regions, the work
                            carried out to convince and involve the directors was difficult and undoubtedly should have
                            been handled as a separate subject entirely (with persons who had been identified, an action
                            plan and a schedule).
                        </p>

                        <h3>Customized labs … but not that diversified</h3>
                        <p>The labs created at the end of the La Transfo experiment share their principal features,
                            which were generally present in the program protocol: lab reporting to the authority’s
                            general management or to an across-the-board sponsoring department, operating methods
                            inspired by design and the social sciences (user research, creative design, tests, etc.),
                            the participation of non-fulltime agents (regular contributors to the lab), a role for
                            spreading an innovation culture focussed on user-based innovation and experimentation… These
                            labs therefore do not reflect lab models that are really different in terms of vision,
                            operating methods and governance.
